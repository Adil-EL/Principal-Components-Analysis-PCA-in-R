# Principal-Components-Analysis-PCA-in-R
Principal component analysis is a technique for feature extraction 
— so it combines the  input variables in a specific way, then we can drop the “least important” 
variables while still retaining the most valuable parts of all of the variables.

This repo shows an explicit way of coding the math under the hood of the PCA in R programming language.
